SiLOX OS Repository (preseed for live installer)
This project is to test and finalize the SiLOX OS distro and the SiLOX OS Live + Installer.iso for live demo use and full installation of the SiLOX OS operating system. You can view more information about this and our PC and portable SiLOX OS hardware at http://sideustech.com. You may contact me at d.tauzin@gmail.com

PS. If you are trying to figure out how to preseed, ALL OF THIS WORKS 100% FUNCTIONING! Debian base 9.6 stretch stable.
